I'm a Duke University grad with 2 years of experience scoping data science projects and building machine learning models to solve real-world problems. Currently, I work as a Data Scientist at [Enigma Technologies](https://www.enigma.com/). Enigma provides the content, tools, and expertise to empower organizations looking to make sense of the world through data. Before Enigma, I worked for the Federal Reserve Board of Governors building statistical models and algorithms to analyze data for U.S. monetary policy, financial regulatory policy, and economic research.

Iâ€™m also extensively involved with [DataKind](http://www.datakind.org/), a data-science non-profit. DataKind brings together data scientists and engineers with leading social change organizations to collaborate on cutting-edge analytics and advanced algorithms to maximize social impact. Currently, I'm the Technical Lead on a four person team working with [Stand For Children](http://stand.org/), an organization dedicated to ensuring that all children, regardless of their background, graduate from high school prepared for, and with access to, college or career training.

Previously, I led a 30-person team to analyze and provide data driven recommendations to improve [young adult employment and education programs in Philadelphia](https://www.pyninc.org/). Before that, I co-built and [deployed](http://home-fire-risk.github.io/smoke_alarm_map/) machine learning models to optimize the Red Cross's national [campaign](http://www.redcross.org/get-help/prepare-for-emergencies/types-of-emergencies/fire/prevent-home-fire) to install 2.5 million smoke detectors across the United States.

As of March 2017, the smoke detector campaign has saved over 200 documented lives.
