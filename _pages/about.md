I'm a Worcester Polytechnic Institute grad with 2 years of experience scoping data science projects and building machine learning models to solve real-world problems. Currently, I work as a Data Scientist Intern at [NeuroScouting](https://www.neuroscouting.com/). Neuroscouting develops advanced applications and training technologies that lead to ways of neuroscience based interventions.
